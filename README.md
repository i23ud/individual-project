# Tic Tac Toe game
A Tic-Tac-Toe game UI, a simple Javascript web applicationcan at the most have 9 moves. The logic for player moves is as follows: Each player goes by pressing on an empty space on the board to mark it with an x or an o. The first person to get 3 x’s or o’s in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally, wins. We’ll use the java script.
